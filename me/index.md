# About Me

Welcome to this corner of the internet dedicated to showcase my work and experience, majorly in the field of Tech.

I was born on 30th Jan 1998, just a few months before Google was ;)

For more than past 5 years I have been involved in different stacks and product pipelines in software development.

>You can find out about the projects I have worked on under Projects folder.

My core competencies lie in Full Stack Web Development, Cloud centered web development (serverless, cloud functions, etc), JavaSE and EE.

Currently my interest areas are web dev, blockchain based applications, ML and AI.

I consider myself to be a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) Advocate.

As such, I conduct sessions on intro to FOSS and more advanced topics in FOSS at local colleges.

I have been involved extensively with local Google Developers Group, located in Pune, for the past 4 years.

I have volunteered with GDG, sometimes organising events and even giving out talks when appropriate.

I am also an official co-organizer for GDG Cloud Pune chapter.

Apart from being a tech nerd, I'm also an amature poet, avid music fan, and a serious binge watcher.

I love travelling whenever I get the chance and making new friends especially when they have a starkly different background than me.

Feel free to contact me any time over provided communication channels to discuss anything and everything tech or just to have a chat!
